          relative (fractional) coordinates (same length as
          explicit_kpoints_abs).
        - ``explicit_kpoints_labels``: list of strings with kpoints labels. It has
          the same length as explicit_kpoints_abs and explicit_kpoints_rel.
          Empty if the point is not a special point.
        - ``explicit_kpoints_linearcoord``: array of floats, giving the coordinate
          at which to plot the corresponding point.
        - ``explicit_segments``: a list of length-2 tuples, with the start and end
          index of each segment. **Note**! The indices are supposed to be
          used as follows: the labels for the i-th segment are given by::

            segment_indices = explicit_segments[i]
            segment_labels = explicit_kpoints_labels[slice(*segment_indices)]

          This means, in particular, that if you want the label of the start
          and end points, you should do::

            start_label = explicit_kpoints_labels[segment_indices[0]]
            stop_label = explicit_kpoints_labels[segment_indices[1]-1]

          that the point was calculated only once, and it belongs to both

          is the X point, and ``explicit_segments[i][0]`` is the R point,
          and typically in a graphical representation they are shown at the

    :py:exc:`~seekpath.SupercellWarning` is issued.

    If you use this module, please cite the paper of the corresponding
    recipe (see parameter below).

    :param structure: The crystal structure for which we want to obtain
        the suggested path. It should be a tuple in the format
        accepted by spglib: (cell, positions, numbers), where
        (if N is the number of atoms):

        - ``cell`` is a :math:`3 \times 3` list of floats (``cell[0]`` is the first lattice
          vector, ...)
        - ``positions`` is a :math:`N \times 3` list of floats with the atomic coordinates
          in scaled coordinates (i.e., w.r.t. the cell vectors)
        - ``numbers`` is a length-:math:`N` list with integers identifying uniquely
          the atoms in the cell (e.g., the Z number of the atom, but
          any other positive non-zero integer will work - e.g. if you
          want to distinguish two Carbon atoms, you can set one number
          to 6 and the other to 1006)

    :param with_time_reversal: if False, and the group has no inversion
        symmetry, additional lines are returned.

    :param reference_distance: a reference target distance between neighboring
        k-points in the path, in units of 1/ang. The actual value will be as
        close as possible to this value, to have an integer number of points in
        each path.

    :param recipe: choose the reference publication that defines the special
       points and paths.
       Currently, the following value is implemented:

       - ``hpkot``: HPKOT paper:
         Y. Hinuma, G. Pizzi, Y. Kumagai, F. Oba, I. Tanaka, Band structure
         diagram paths based on crystallography, Comp. Mat. Sci. 128, 140 (2017).
         DOI: 10.1016/j.commatsci.2016.10.015

    :param threshold: the threshold to use to verify if we are in
        and edge case (e.g., a tetragonal cell, but ``a==c``). For instance,
        in the tI lattice, if ``abs(a-c) < threshold``, a
        :py:exc:`~seekpath.hpkot.EdgeCaseWarning` is issued.
        Note that depending on the bravais lattice, the meaning of the
        threshold is different (angle, length, ...)

    :param symprec: the symmetry precision used internally by SPGLIB

    :param angle_tolerance: the angle_tolerance used internally by SPGLIB

    .. versionchanged:: 1.8
        The key ``segments`` has been renamed ``explicit_segments``
        for consistency.

    :return: a dictionary with a number of keys. They are the same as
        ``get_path_orig_cell``, plus a few ones:

        - ``explicit_kpoints_abs``: List of the kpoints along the specific path in
          absolute (Cartesian) coordinates. The two endpoints are always
          included, independently of the length.
        - ``explicit_kpoints_rel``: List of the kpoints along the specific path in
          relative (fractional) coordinates (same length as
          explicit_kpoints_abs).
        - ``explicit_kpoints_labels``: list of strings with kpoints labels. It has
          the same length as explicit_kpoints_abs and explicit_kpoints_rel.
          Empty if the point is not a special point.
        - ``explicit_kpoints_linearcoord``: array of floats, giving the coordinate
          at which to plot the corresponding point.
        - ``explicit_segments``: a list of length-2 tuples, with the start and end
          index of each segment. **Note**! The indices are supposed to be
          used as follows: the labels for the i-th segment are given by::

            segment_indices = explicit_segments[i]
            segment_labels = explicit_kpoints_labels[slice(*segment_indices)]

          This means, in particular, that if you want the label of the start
          and end points, you should do::

            start_label = explicit_kpoints_labels[segment_indices[0]]
            stop_label = explicit_kpoints_labels[segment_indices[1]-1]

          (note the minus one!)

          Also, note that if
          ``explicit_segments[i-1][1] == explicit_segments[i][0] + 1`` it means
          that the point was calculated only once, and it belongs to both
          paths. Instead, if
          ``explicit_segments[i-1][1] == explicit_segments[i][0]``, then
          this is a 'break' point in the path (e.g., ``explicit_segments[i-1][1]``
          is the X point, and ``explicit_segments[i][0]`` is the R point,
          and typically in a graphical representation they are shown at the
          same coordinate, with a label ``R|X``).
